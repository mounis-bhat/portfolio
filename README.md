## FAQ

#### yarn dev / npm run dev is failing

This is a known issue with NextJS 12, it uses a rust compiler to load SWC binaries and it's failing, to avoid this create a .babelrc file in your root directory and use {
"presets": ["next/babel"]
}, this will set babel as your default compiler. To avoid using babel compiler in your prodcution build, git ignore .babelrc and let vercel deploy a prodcution build with rust compiler.
